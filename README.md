# Assignment 6 - The ToDo-List

## Learning Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to strengthen your knowledge about SQL. It includes CREATE TABLE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands.<br/>
Furthermore, in this challenge, you will work with Express routes and multiple HTTP Requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).<br/>

The goal is to create a small TODO-List application where you can create new tasks, set them as `Done` (i.e. tick them off), and delete tasks altogether.

_Note: If you want to test your sub-routes (`/todo/...`) before implementing the frontend, consider using Postman (https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) for this._

## Tasks

### Task 0 - Install the project

Run `npm install` and then run the script from your `package.json`. Find out where the port of your application is defined.

### Task 1 - Create table

Have a look at `Database.js` and fill in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Your table should have the following fields:

- id = the primary key & identifier
- task = the name of the task
- priority = integer betwen 1 and 4
- done = boolean flag

You can get some helpful resources here (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/index.htm) and here (https://developerhowto.com/2018/12/29/build-a-rest-api-with-node-js-and-express-js/).

### Task 2 - Implement the SELECT query

Implement the "SELECT ... FROM ..." query to get all relevant rows for your todo list. Replace the static object array in `routes/index.js`

### Task 3 - Implement /add

Implement the "INSERT INTO ..." query to create a new TODO list item in `routes/todo.js`

### Task 4 - Implement /delete

Implement the "DELETE FROM ..." query. Send the ID in the request body (like a POST request).

### Task 5 - Implement /done

Implement the "UPDATE todo SET ..." query. Send the ID in the request body (like a POST request).<br/>

_Bonus: If you want to be able to untick TODOs, send also the `done=true/false` inside the payload._

### Task 6 - Implement frontend dynamics

Write some Javascript functions to send your requests to the adjacent `/todo/...` route. Consider reloading the page manually or return a redirect response to the main page.
